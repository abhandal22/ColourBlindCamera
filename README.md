# Colour Blind Camera

This is the Colour Blind Camera project by Arshvir Bhandal. The purpose of this application is to allow people who are not colour blind to see what colour blind people are seeing. Users will be able to upload images and select what type and severity of colour blindness they would like to see the image in. Users will also be able to view other users' uploaded and filtered images in a gallery. The model utilized for the conversions in this project is "The Physiologically-based Model for Simulation of Color Vision Deficiency" by Gustavo M. Machado, Manuel M. Oliveira, Leandro A. F. Fernandes.  

The Colour Blind Camera application can be used by anyone interested in seeing what it would be like to see the world differently. I wanted to make this project because I thought it would be important to spread knowledge about something others struggle with and allow people to put themselves in others' shoes and see through their eyes.
